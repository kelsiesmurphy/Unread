<!-- ABOUT -->
### Unread

<!-- BRIEF -->
Unread is a book tracking app created for the CodeClan Javascript group project in week 9 of the professional software development course. It allows multiple users to track the books they read, and select new ones from the OpenLibrary API.
It was created in January 2023 by Andromeda, Anne, Delphine and Kelsie.

#### MVP
The application should be able to:
* Allow a user to search books from an API, find a specific one and add it to the database
* Allow them to add and remove books from their personal library.
* Mark a book as read, or still to read.
* Allow for multiple users within the app.

#### Future Extensions
* Suggest a book - randomly generated from the app
* Using a graph to see your progress over the year. A visual of your books per year.
* Share a book externally - send a book to another user in the app 
* Share a book externally - send a book by email

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To run this app, you must run the following in the client directory: 
* pnpm install
  ```sh
  pnpm install
  ```

* run in development
  ```sh
  pnpm run dev
  ```
  
  Then you must navigate to the server directory and run the following: 
* pnpm install
  ```sh
  pnpm install
  ```
  
* seed the database
  ```sh
  npm run seeds
  ```

* get the server running
  ```sh
  pnpm run server:dev
  ```
Note: To stop the server enter ctrl + c in your Terminal

<!-- REFLECTIONS -->
## Reflections
I believe we achieved a great deal as a team within the timeframe, and there were several opportunities to mentor other members of the team and be mentored back. In a future project, I intend to focus more closely on the testing aspect of the project.
