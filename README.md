<!-- ABOUT -->
### Unread

<!-- BRIEF -->
Unread is a book tracking app created for the CodeClan Javascript group project in week 9 of the professional software development course. It allows multiple users to track the books they read, and select new ones from the OpenLibrary API.
It was created in January 2023 by Andromeda, Anne, Delphine and Kelsie.

#### MVP
The application should be able to:
* Allow a user to search books from an API, find a specific one and add it to the database
* Allow them to add and remove books from their personal library.
* Mark a book as read, or still to read.
* Allow for multiple users within the app.

#### Future Extensions
* Suggest a book - randomly generated from the app
* Using a graph to see your progress over the year. A visual of your books per year.
* Share a book externally - send a book to another user in the app 
* Share a book externally - send a book by email
